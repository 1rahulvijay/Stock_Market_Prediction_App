Here’s a sample README file for your Python code. This document outlines the purpose, setup, and usage of the script.

README: SQL Query Execution, Excel Report Generation, and Country-Based Email Sending

Overview

This Python script automates the process of:
	1.	Executing SQL queries.
	2.	Generating an Excel report based on the query results.
	3.	Sending emails with the generated report to recipients, categorized by country.

It is designed to streamline the reporting workflow by integrating database operations, file generation, and email functionality.

Requirements

Ensure the following are installed before running the script:
	1.	Python (>= 3.8)
	2.	Required Python libraries:
	•	pandas (for data manipulation and Excel creation)
	•	openpyxl (for working with Excel files)
	•	pyodbc or sqlalchemy (for database connectivity)
	•	smtplib or yagmail (for sending emails)
	•	dotenv (for managing environment variables)

Install the libraries with:

pip install pandas openpyxl pyodbc yagmail python-dotenv

	3.	Access to the database and email credentials.

Setup

1. Database Configuration

Update the connection string in the script to match your database credentials. Example for pyodbc:

conn_str = (
    "DRIVER={SQL Server};"
    "SERVER=your_server_name;"
    "DATABASE=your_database_name;"
    "UID=your_username;"
    "PWD=your_password;"
)

2. Email Configuration

Store email credentials in a .env file for security.
Example .env file:

EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587

3. Country-Specific Email Mapping

Define a mapping between countries and email recipients in the script:

country_email_map = {
    "USA": ["us_recipient@example.com"],
    "India": ["in_recipient@example.com"],
    "Germany": ["de_recipient@example.com"],
}

Usage

1. Running the Script

Run the script from the command line:

python
